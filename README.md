Thanks for taking the time to review my coding challenge submission! You can find build instructions below.

## Build Instructions
This process assumes that you already have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If that is the case, simply:
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Run `% npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `% npm run dev` to start the Next.js dev server.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ (if it didn't open in your default browser automatically already).
