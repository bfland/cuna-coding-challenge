Thanks for taking the time to review my coding challenge submission!

## Build Instructions
This process assumes that you already have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If that is the case, simply:
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Run `% npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `% npm run dev` to start the Next.js dev server.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ (if it didn't open in your default browser automatically already).

## What Code Did I Actually Write?
I used Next.js for this project, so a lot of the code was spun up on my behalf. Here is a list of what I actually wrote or changed:
1. I **created** the `src/` directory, and wrote all the code contained within it.
2. I **created** `pages/api/qualify.ts`.
3. I **created** `pages/disqualified.tsx` and `pages/new-account.tsx`.
4. I **modified** `pages/index.tsx` and `pages/_app.tsx`.
